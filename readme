This Application handles large serialized databases and classifies each items tone depending on the words used. 

With the use of a sentiment analyzing AI being fed each review, the files are classified and displayed to a table formatted GUI.

JAVADOC implemented as part of the design process and has been previously generated. 

This program was coordinated with another team member and the use of design patterns during the planning phase was very prevalent.
